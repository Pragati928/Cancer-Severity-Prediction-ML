## üìò Project Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive data analysis of cancer patients (2015‚Äì2024)**, focusing on identifying key risk factors, lifestyle influences, and treatment outcomes.  
The study uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical correlation, and machine learning (Random Forest) to understand **what influences cancer severity and survival rates**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics, lifestyle, and environmental factors.  
- Examine trends in survival years and severity levels.  
- Identify which factors most influence cancer severity using ML models.  
- Visualize key findings through KDE plots, histograms, and feature importance charts.

---

## üß© Dataset Information
> **Note:** The dataset represents **anonymized and simulated cancer patient data (2015‚Äì2024)** curated for educational and research purposes.  
It contains 50,000 patient records with attributes such as age, gender, cancer type, stage, risk factors, and treatment cost.  

**Key Columns:**
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Country_Region`, `Cancer_Type`, `Cancer_Stage`  
- `Genetic_Risk`, `Air_Pollution`, `Alcohol_Use`, `Smoking`, `Obesity_Level`  
- `Treatment_Cost_USD`, `Survival_Years`, `Target_Severity_Score`

## üîç Data Exploration

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Age Distribution
- KDE and Histogram plots reveal a uniform age distribution from **20‚Äì90 years**.  
- Most patients are middle-aged (40‚Äì70 years).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics (Age)
| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Mean | 54.4 |
| Std Dev | 20.22 |
| Min | 20 |
| 75th Percentile | 72 |
| Max | 89 |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Observations
- Cancer cases are evenly distributed across age groups.  
- Majority of patients belong to the **45‚Äì75** age range, indicating higher vulnerability in mid-to-senior populations.

## üìà Correlation & Statistical Insights
| Feature | Correlation (Severity) | Key Insight |
|----------|------------------------|--------------|
| Smoking | 0.48 | Highest positive impact on severity |
| Genetic_Risk | 0.47 | Strong hereditary influence |
| Air_Pollution | 0.36 | Moderate environmental impact |
| Alcohol_Use | 0.36 | Noticeable lifestyle factor |
| Obesity_Level | 0.25 | Low correlation |
| Age | ‚âà 0.00 | Minimal direct effect |

‚úÖ **Inference:**  
Smoking, genetic predisposition, and pollution show the strongest link to higher cancer severity, suggesting lifestyle and environment are critical contributors.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning ‚Äì Random Forest Model

**Model:** RandomForestRegressor  
**Target Variable:** `Target_Severity_Score`

| Metric | Score |
|---------|--------|
| **Train R¬≤** | 0.97 |
| **Test R¬≤** | 0.77 |

### üìä Top Predictors of Severity
| Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Smoking | 0.23 | Most influential on severity |
| Genetic_Risk | 0.22 | Almost equally impactful |
| Treatment_Cost_USD | 0.21 | Higher costs correlate with higher severity |
| Alcohol_Use | 0.13 | Moderate impact |
| Air_Pollution | 0.12 | Environmental effect |
| Obesity_Level | 0.05 | Minor influence |
| Age / Gender | <0.01 | Minimal effect |

‚úÖ **Conclusion:**  
The model performed well, capturing most variance in severity with limited overfitting.  
Top drivers of cancer severity are **Smoking**, **Genetic Risk**, and **Environmental Factors**.
